# FizzBuzz-Challange
FizzBuzz Challange in C++.  


You need to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 such that:

    If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Fizz" instead of that number.
    If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Buzz" instead of that number.
    If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.
